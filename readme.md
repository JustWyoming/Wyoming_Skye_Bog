#Skye Bog App
A Ruby on Rails Project

[Visit Site](http://skyebog.herokuapp.com)

###Description:
At General Assembly we created a basic CRUD app in Ruby on Rails our first week into the Ruby language. We were to have users be able to add a creature, edit a creature and tag a creature. We needed to be able to delete and edit as well. We used the Flickr API to feed in imagery related to the creature name. I wanted to create an app that was beautiful, and also an hommage to faeries and mythical creatures. Because I'm a nerd and I like that kind of thing.

###Challenges:
Deploying to Heroku from Rails with the built in Rails database was messy. It required a lot of re-arranging, and the process took longer than my experiences with Node.js, Express and PostgresSQL. There were also font issues with Google Web Fonts, so I elected to create a typekit for the project.

###Wishlist:
With more time, I'd choose a different framework, or re-do the site entirely in css of my own, using LESS or SASS. I don't love how Bootstrap handles responsive tables. Because the content of this app really lends itself to tables, I would have preferred to find another way to display the results.

###Tools:
Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap Form_for Gem, Flickr API, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, the always amazing artists on Deviant Art.
